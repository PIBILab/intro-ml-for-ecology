# intro-ml-for-ecology

Welcome to a brief introduction to the use of machine learning methods in Ecology.

This repo aims to give educational resources for brief overview of the machine learning methods for ecology. 
All scripts are done using R and the analyses require different packages (e.g., caret, randomForest, xgboost, ipred, etc.).

The repo contains three subfolders (data, functions, and codes) and covers differents machine learning analysis:

1. Tree-based methods

Classification and regression

2. Pixel classification 

Image classification using machine learning algorithms

3. Neural networks 

Note: The description of the scripts, functions, and data are given in Report.pdf(documentation).
